# ChipKrypt Back End

## Overview
Welcome to the backend repository of ChipKrypt. 

## Learning Journey
Setting up the backend was a blend of leveraging past learnings and exploring new territories, 
especially Firebase. Here are some sources that helped
- [Django and REST Framework](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IVtds5ufLY)
- [API Development Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wa4AHGKUJM&list=PLhPDb5zFmGR2VfXiN2y-1V0qdRik7Cc0K)
- [Firebase and Django Integration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBA-jaWab9k)
- [Advanced Django Features](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3qnyDscl0w)
- https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/# (API DOCS I USED)
- https://firebase.google.com/docs (FIREBASE DOCS)

## API Endpoints
- `/currencies`: Fetches the latest cryptocurrency data.
- `/coinmarketcap-data`: Retrieves detailed market data.
- `/crypto-details/<str:symbol>`: Provides specifics of a selected cryptocurrency.

## Running the API Locally
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required Python packages.
3. Run the Django server to get the API up and running.

## Future Developments
- Expanding API capabilities to include historical data analysis.
- Enhancing data security and response times.
